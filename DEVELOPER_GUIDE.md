# Developer Guide: Self-Review Process

## üéØ Overview
This guide walks you through performing a self-assessment of your entity using our structured review process. Your self-assessment will be reviewed in a meeting with your team lead, and upon agreement, the scores will be integrated into the main scorecard system.

## üìã Prerequisites
- Your entity must exist in the Backstage catalog
- You should have a good understanding of your entity's current state
- Access to create Pull Requests in this repository

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Create Your Self-Assessment

1. **Create a new branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b self-review/your-entity-name
   ```

2. **Copy the template**:
   ```bash
   cp self-review-process/templates/entity-score-template.json \\
      self-review-process/entity-scores/your-entity-name.json
   ```

3. **Update the entity reference**:
   - Replace `YOUR_ENTITY_NAME_HERE` with your actual entity name
   - Ensure the `kind` and `namespace` match your catalog entity exactly

### Step 2: Complete Your Assessment

For each assessment area (Code, Documentation, Operations, Quality):

#### üîç Assessment Guidelines

**Score Ranges:**
- **90-100%**: Excellent - Best practices implemented, regularly maintained
- **80-89%**: Good - Well implemented with minor gaps
- **70-79%**: Satisfactory - Implemented but needs improvement
- **60-69%**: Needs Work - Basic implementation, significant gaps
- **50-59%**: Poor - Minimal implementation, major issues
- **0-49%**: Critical - Not implemented or severely broken
- **Unknown**: Not applicable or not assessed

**For each item:**

1. **Assess honestly** - This is for improvement, not performance evaluation
2. **Change `scoreSuccess`** from `"unknown"` to appropriate category
3. **Set `scorePercent`** if you have a specific percentage in mind
4. **Update `selfAssessmentComments`** - Remove "TODO" and add your assessment
5. **Add `scoreHints`** if you have evidence (links, documents, etc.)
6. **Fill `improvementPlan`** if score is below 80%

#### üìù Assessment Tips

**Be Specific:**
- ‚ùå "We have monitoring"
- ‚úÖ "Application Insights configured with custom dashboards, 5 alerting rules, 95% uptime SLA"

**Provide Evidence:**
- Link to dashboards, documentation, or repositories
- Mention specific tools, processes, or metrics
- Reference recent improvements or initiatives

**Identify Gaps:**
- What's missing compared to best practices?
- What would you implement with more time/resources?
- What dependencies are blocking improvements?

### Step 3: Create Pull Request

1. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add self-review-process/entity-scores/your-entity-name.json
   git commit -m "Self-review assessment for your-entity-name"
   git push origin self-review/your-entity-name
   ```

2. **Create Pull Request** with title: `Self-Review: your-entity-name`

3. **Fill PR description** with:
   ```markdown
   ## Self-Review Summary for [Your Entity Name]
   
   ### Current Overall Assessment
   - **Estimated Score**: X% (based on my assessment)
   - **Strongest Areas**: List 2-3 areas where you excel
   - **Areas for Improvement**: List 2-3 priority areas
   
   ### Key Highlights
   - Briefly describe what you're most proud of
   - Mention any recent improvements or initiatives
   
   ### Improvement Priorities
   1. **High Priority**: Most critical gap to address
   2. **Medium Priority**: Important but not blocking
   3. **Low Priority**: Nice to have improvements
   
   ### Questions for Review Meeting
   - Any specific areas you'd like feedback on
   - Questions about scoring criteria
   - Resource needs for improvements
   
   ### Meeting Availability
   - Preferred times for review meeting
   - Any scheduling constraints
   ```

4. **Assign reviewers** - Usually your team lead or designated reviewer

### Step 4: Review Meeting Preparation

**Before the meeting:**
- Review your assessment for accuracy
- Prepare evidence/examples for your scores
- Think about improvement priorities and resource needs
- List any questions or uncertainties

**During the meeting:**
- Walk through your assessment area by area
- Provide context and evidence for scores
- Discuss improvement opportunities
- Agree on final scores and action items

### Step 5: Post-Meeting Updates

After the meeting, your reviewer will:
1. Update the score file with agreed-upon scores
2. Add reviewer information and meeting notes
3. Document action items with owners and deadlines
4. Approve and merge the PR

The system will automatically:
- Validate the updated scores
- Calculate aggregated scores
- Update the main `all.json` file
- Make scores visible in Backstage

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What if I don't know how to score something?
Use `"scoreSuccess": "unknown"` and note your uncertainty in comments. Discuss during the review meeting.

### Q: Should I be conservative or optimistic in scoring?
Be realistic and honest. This is for improvement, not evaluation. Err on the side of being honest about gaps.

### Q: What if my entity is different from the standard template?
Mark non-applicable items as `"isOptional": true` and explain in comments. Discuss adaptations during review.

### Q: How often should we do self-reviews?
Recommended quarterly, or after major changes/releases. Your team can set their own cadence.

### Q: What happens to improvement action items?
They should be tracked in your regular sprint planning. Consider creating GitHub issues or Jira tickets.

### Q: Can I update my scores later?
Yes, create a new PR with updates. The system maintains history of changes.
